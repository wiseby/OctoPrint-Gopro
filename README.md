# OctoPrint-Gopro

Do you have a GoPro Camera laying around? Tierd of the low quality frames captured by your cheap webcam?
This plugin enables you to benefit from many of the good features the GoPro offers. 
Its a simple plugin that will get a command to take a photo every time the timelapse evenmt is raised.
the best part is the wireless communications built in to the camera. The only connection necessary is the power (battery life will limit the length of the timelapse)

## Compatibility
